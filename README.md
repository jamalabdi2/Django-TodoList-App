# Django-TodoList-App
  Welcome to the Django-TodoList-App! This is a FullStack Todo List application built using Python/Django and Bootstrap.

# Current Status
  At the moment, the project is still a work in progress and is not yet finished. However, I have made use of functional-based views. 
  While functional views are perfectly fine, Django emphasizes code reuse and reducing duplication, 
  so I plan to switch to class-based views to take advantage of these benefits.

# Features Under Development
  Here are the features that I will be working on:

   1.User Authentication and Authorization: 

   2.Custom User Model

   3.PostgreSQL Integration: Replacing the current SQLite database with PostgreSQL. 

   4.API Integration with Django Rest Framework

   5.Deployment with Docker and Heroku

   6.Frontend with React

# Technology Used
 Here are the technologies utilized in this project:

   1.Python

   2.Django

   3.SQLite3

   4.Bootstrap
